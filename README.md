# AvellanedaSimulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Avellaneda-Stoikov model, a stochastic control framework used for market making strategies. The model helps determine optimal bid and ask quotes to maximize profits while managing inventory risk.

## Features

- **Market Simulation:** Simulate market conditions using historical data or generated scenarios.
- **Optimal Quote Calculation:** Compute optimal bid and ask quotes based on the Avellaneda-Stoikov model.
- **Inventory Management:** Manage inventory levels to minimize risk and maximize profit.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate key performance metrics such as profit, inventory turnover, and Sharpe ratio.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rainbowbrained/AvellanedaSimulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd AvellanedaSimulation
   ```

3. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python simulation.py
   ```

4. Customize parameters and scenarios as needed in the `simulation.py` file.
